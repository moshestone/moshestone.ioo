  <h2> About</h2>
  <p class ="size"> My name is Moshe Stone and this website is my portfolio,
     showcasing work I have done. This website covers mainly my first year in
     college and the work I did there. It is for the BTEC Extended Certificate
     qualification and my website has one page for each unit I have covered.
     I am 16 years old and this is my first year in College. The picture on the left is one of me.
     I am also doing maths and english at college. <br>
   In the future, I would like a job in I.T. perhaps specialising in A.I. or cybersecurity.
 Those two topics interest me. <br> <br>
The BTEC course I am doing is one year long and has eight different units in it. You can see
all the units I have done since there is one page for each of them on this website.<br> <br>
If you would like to see all the assignment I have written for the units then click on this link.

target="_blank">Folder</a>It opens up in a new tab. <br>
I have uploaded them to google drive in a shared folder so you can view them.</p>

<p class="size"> I entered college when I turned 16. I did not have any previous qualifications
  from high school. That is because I left high school when I was 13 because my mother died.
  If i had carried on going to school i would have taken my GCSEs one year early. Now, I have just
  finished fucntional skills Level 2 Maths and English in College and I have passed both of them. Next year
  I will be doing Maths and English GCSEs. This year I am on track to get a D*D* in this BTEC.
