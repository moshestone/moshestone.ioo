 <p class="size"> I have done work experience at a company called Code Nation. On the left
   there is a screenshot of their website.<a href="https://www.wearecodenation.com">Link To Website </a> It taught
 me how life is like in the work world which is quite different to college. I got used to a working environment
where you have to be there every day from 9 o clock to 5 every day. I was taught how to do some coding in
JavaScript and was asked to make a skills tree for their website. I was also shown around marketing and was given a few jobs
to think of marketing ideas based on specific criteria.</p>
 <!-- go there very day and 9-5, showed me how to do some coding, marketing example... -->

 <p class="size"> I have a job working as a cashier at a grocery store in my neighberhood. I work three days a week.
    despite having a job, I make sure it does not interfere with my studying. On the left there is an image
    of the shop I work at. It teaches me to be on time when I go to work and that I can not cancel if I do not feel
  like going. I also have to let them know in advance if I want time off.</p>
